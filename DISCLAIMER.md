# ‚ö†Ô∏è DISCLAIMER

## Educational Purpose Only

**This Zoho Attendance API project is created solely for educational and learning purposes. It is NOT intended for production use or commercial deployment.**

### üéì Educational Scope

This Zoho Attendance API automation system serves as a:
- **Learning example** for Node.js API development and automation
- **Demonstration** of OAuth 2.0 implementation with Zoho APIs
- **Educational resource** for understanding server-side automation concepts
- **Code reference** for Docker containerization and cron job scheduling
- **Tutorial project** for REST API integration and token management

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Critical Warnings

#### **Do NOT use this in production environments because:**

1. **Security Risks**
   - Stores sensitive OAuth credentials in environment variables
   - No comprehensive security auditing performed
   - Automated API calls may bypass security measures
   - Token management lacks enterprise-grade security
   - Docker container runs with elevated permissions

2. **Legal & Compliance Issues**
   - **May violate company attendance policies**
   - **Could breach employment contracts and labor laws**
   - **Automated attendance manipulation may constitute fraud**
   - **May violate Zoho People Terms of Service**
   - **Could result in disciplinary action or termination**
   - **May have legal implications in jurisdictions with strict labor laws**

3. **Technical & Reliability Concerns**
   - No error recovery for failed API calls
   - Limited testing across different Zoho configurations
   - Cron scheduling may miss critical attendance windows
   - No backup or failover mechanisms
   - API rate limiting not comprehensively handled

4. **Ethical & Professional Issues**
   - **Fundamentally dishonest practice**
   - **Undermines trust between employer and employee**
   - **Violates the spirit of attendance tracking**
   - **May create unfair advantage over colleagues**
   - **Contradicts professional integrity standards**
